      "Dexmo started out as a personal project of the founder and CEO Aler Gu. The first generation of Dexmo was machined, silver welded and hand made from brass. Then we take this idea further and combine it with advanced robotics technology to improve the immersion of VR/MR.",

      "Building something that never existed before from scratch is hard work, but luckily we are engineers who enjoy challenges. Over the past years we have built and tested more than 50 generations of Dexmo to verify the feasibility of different wearing mechanism, various force feedback methods and countless manufacturing techniques.",

      "These valuable experiences help us to break down technical barriers while improving the user experience step by step. From the initial brass prototype, to 3D prints and to today's mass production, we are steadily pushing the boundary of human-machine-interaction technology."

      " Dexmo源自创始人兼CEO谷逍驰的个人项目。第一代Dexmo是经机械加工和银焊，由黄铜手工制作而成的。然后我们进一步将这一理念与先进的机器人技术相结合，提高VR/MR的沉浸感。",
      "从零开始构建前所未有的产品是一项艰巨的任务，但幸运的是，我们是喜欢挑战的工程师。多年来，我们制造、测试了50多个迭代版本，验证了不同磨损机制、不同力反馈方式和无数的制造方式的可行性。",
      "这些宝贵的经验在帮助我们逐步提高用户体验的同时也帮助我们打破技术壁垒。从最早的黄铜原型到3D打印，再到如今的大规模生产，我们正在稳步推进人机交互技术的边界。"
